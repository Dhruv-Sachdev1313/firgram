## About

*__This project tries to solve for Good Health & Wellbeing, which is one of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals working towards eliminating the struggle of availing medical treatment during the time of need. Due to COVID and even otherwise, getting hospital beds is really difficult, at least in a crowded city like Mumbai.__*
